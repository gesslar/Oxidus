# LPC Coding Style Guide

This document prepares an LLM for how code should be written in LPC for this project.

## Spacing

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas.
- NO space after keywords (e.g., `if`, `while`, `for`).
- No trailing spaces at the end of lines or files.
- Use a single space after `//` for comments.
- NO space after `#` for preprocessor directives.
- Use a single space before and after `=` for assignments.
- Use a single space after `,` for function arguments and parameter lists.
- NO space before or after `;` for statement terminators.
- NO space space after `(` and before `)` for function calls and definitions.
- NO space after `{` and before `}` for blocks.
- NO space after `[` and before `]` for array indexing.
- NO space after `.` for member access.
- NO space after `->` for pointer member access.
- Use a single space before and after `?` and before and after `:` for ternary operators.
- NO space after `!` for negation.

## Bracing Style

- Opening braces for control structures are placed on the same line as the statement.
- Closing braces get their own line unless followed by an `else` or similar continuations.
- Single-statement blocks still use braces.
- Example:

  ```lpc
  if(condition) {
    // code
  } else {
    // more code
  }
  ```

## Declarations

FluffOS LPC does not support hoisting of declarations, so all declarations must be at the top of the scope where they are used. This means that you cannot declare variables or functions anywhere in the code.

### Variables

All variables should be declared at the top of the function, block, or scope where it is used. This does not mean that you should declare all variables at the top of the file or a function, if it can be scoped more locally.

Variables being declared at the top of a scope is a requirement of FluffOS LPC, as it does not support C-style declarations. This means that you cannot declare just anywhere.

Global variables may be declared anywhere before they are used, but often they are declared at the top of the file. This is not a requirement, but it is a good practice to keep them together.

### Functions

All functions should have a forward declaration at the top of the file, especially before the first use. This is a requirement of FluffOS LPC, as it does not support C-style declarations. This means that you cannot declare just anywhere.

## Variable Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable.
- Local variables use `snake_case` (all lowercase, words separated by underscores).
- Global variables follow the same style as local variables.
- Constants (using #define) use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.
- Class member variables follow the same style as local variables.

## Function Naming

- Function names predominantly use `snake_case` (e.g., `query_name`, `set_value`, `calculate_damage`).
- Only class names use `CamelCase` (e.g., `ClassEvent`, `GameState`).
- Function names should be descriptive verbs or verb phrases that indicate what the function does.
- Accessor functions commonly use the prefix `query_` rather than `get_` (e.g., `query_level`, `query_name`).
- Mutator functions commonly use the prefix `set_` (e.g., `set_level`, `set_name`).

## Control Structures

- Blank lines between logical sections of code.
- For switch statements, the `case` keyword is not indented, but case content is indented one level.
- Always include a `default` case in switch statements when appropriate.
- Example:

  ```lpc
  switch(value) {
    case 1:
      // code
      break;
    case 2:
      // code
      break;
    default:
      // code
      break;
  }
  ```

## Comments

- File headers use block comments to describe the file's purpose.
- Function documentation is placed directly above the function definition.
- Use line comments (`//`) for inline clarifications.
- Complex algorithms should be explained with comments.
- Comment style should follow LPCDoc conventions for public APIs.

## Error Handling

- Use `catch` blocks for error handling where appropriate.
- Consider returning error messages or error codes rather than throwing errors when possible.
- Use `error()` for fatal conditions that should stop execution.
- Log errors with appropriate information for later debugging.

## Type Handling

- Use explicit type checks where necessary (e.g., `objectp()`, `stringp()`, etc.).
- Prefer null-safe code using `nullp()` checks rather than relying on implicit conversions.
- When working with potentially missing or undefined values, check with `nullp()` before use.
- Remember that null/undefined values are ints and are 0, but they are not the same as 0, and can be tested with `nullp()`.
- After testing for null, you can then use `intp()` to check if the value is an int, particularly when validating call_other function arguments.

## File Organization

- Each file should have a header comment describing its purpose and author.
- Header includes come first.
- Inherit statements, if necessary, follow header includes.
- Forward declarations come next.
- Global variables follow forward declarations.
- Helper/utility functions placed at the bottom of the file.
- Primary functions should be at the top of the file.
- Related functions should be grouped together.
- Keep file length manageable - consider splitting very large files (>1000 lines) into modules.

## Special LPC Features

### Efuns and Apply Functions

- Driver efuns (built-in functions) are called directly without a namespace.
- Apply functions (like `init()`, `heart_beat()`) are special methods called by the driver - don't rename these.
- Simulated efuns may be provided by the mudlib and called as global functions.

### Inheritance and Object References

- Use the available macros when inheriting (e.g., `inherit STD_ROOM;`).
- When inheriting, use standard method calling convention for inherited functions (e.g., `::setup();`).
- For loading objects, prefer `load_object()` for static instances and `clone_object()` for creating new instances.
- Use `this_object()` to refer to the current object and `previous_object()` for the calling object.

### LPC-Specific Data Handling

- Use `copy()` when returning mappings or arrays to avoid reference issues, unless you want to share the reference.
- Prefer explicit casting (e.g., `to_int()`, `to_string()`) over implicit type conversion.
- Use varargs for optional parameters: `varargs void func(int required, int optional)`
- The rest operator `...` can be used to handle variable argument lists, but only if the function is declared with `varargs`, and the syntax is `varargs void func(int required, int optional...)`.
- The spread operator `...` can be used to handle variable argument lists, and the syntax is `func(x, arg....)` where `arg` is an array of arguments to be spread by the function.

### Call Methods

- Use `call_other(obj, "func", args...)` or `obj->func(args...)` for dynamic method calls.

## Defensive Programming

- Validate all inputs, especially those from user input or network sources.
- Check for null with `nullp()` before operations that might fail on null values.
- For user-provided objects, verify they exist with `objectp()` before use.
- When dealing with user input, never trust it - sanitize it first.

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid expensive operations in frequently called functions.
- Cache results of expensive calculations where appropriate.
- Be mindful of eval cost limits for complex operations.
- Use call_out, or call_out_walltime for delayed execution rather than busy loops.
- Prefer filter/map/member_array over manual iteration where appropriate.
